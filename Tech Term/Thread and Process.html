<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">&nbsp;A <strong>Program</strong> is an executable file containing a set of instructions and passively<strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;"> stored on a disk</span></strong>. One program can have multiple processes. For example, the Chrome browser creates a different process for every single tab.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">A&nbsp;<strong>Process</strong>&nbsp;means a program is in execution. When a program is <span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>loaded into the memory</strong></span> and becomes active, the program becomes a process. The process requires some essential resources such as registers, program counter, and stack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">A&nbsp;<strong>Thread</strong>&nbsp;is the <strong>smallest unit of execution within a process.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The following process explains the relationship between program, process, and thread.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">1. The program contains a set of instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">2. The program is loaded into memory. It becomes one or more running processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">3. When a process starts, it is assigned memory and resources. A process can have one or more threads. For example, in the Microsoft Word app, a thread might be responsible for spelling checking and the other thread for inserting text into the doc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Main differences between process and thread:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ðŸ”¹ Processes are usually independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ðŸ”¹ Each process has its own memory space. Threads that belong to the same process share the same memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ðŸ”¹ A process is a heavyweight operation. It takes more time to create and terminate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ðŸ”¹ Context switching is more expensive between processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">ðŸ”¹ Inter-thread communication is faster for threads.</span></p>
